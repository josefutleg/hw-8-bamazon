Welcome to Bamazon!

Run 'node bamazonCustomer.js' and the app will ask what type of drink you would like. No parameters needed.
Bamazon's stock consists of 3 options of beer, whiskey, cognac, and miscellaneous (ie water)
Once you select a drink type, you will see three products of your selected type. 
Input the item's ID of your selected drink and how many you would like to purchase.
If Bamazon's stock quantity is less than your request, you will be notified and the app will disconnect.
Before you complete your purchase, you will be prompted to either confirm or change your mind and place a new order.

For examples of the app, refer to the folder, Node Sample for image samples.
